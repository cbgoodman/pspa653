At the beginning of every class, I will post a quiz on iCollege with the following questions:\nAre you here in class today?  Yes (3.5 points) No (0 points)  How much of today’s reading did you finish?  100% (6 points) 75–99% (5 points) 50–74% (4 points) 11–49% (2 points) 0–10% (0 points)  How well did you read?  I was engaged and read carefully (6 points) I was fairly engaged and read fairly carefully (4 points) I skimmed it (2 points) I didn’t read it at all (0 points)   Each day is worth 15.5 points. It is unlikely that you’ll score a 15.5 every day.3 Your total preparation score will naturally shift up at the end of the semester, though, since the preparation category is worth 210 points rather than 217 (15.5 × 14), so be honest—there’s wiggle room in the point system for honesty.\n Problem sets To practice writing R code, running inferential models, and thinking about causation, you will complete a series of problem sets.\nThere are 7 problem sets on the schedule. I will keep the highest grades for 6 of them. That is, I will drop the lowest score (even if it’s a zero). This means you can skip one of the problem sets. You need to show that you made a good faith effort to work each question. I will not grade these in detail. The problem sets will be graded using a check system:\n ✔+: (33 points (110%) in gradebook) Problem set is 100% completed. Every question was attempted and answered, and most answers are correct. Document is clean and easy to follow. Work is exceptional. I will not assign these often. ✔: (28 points (93%) in gradebook) Problem set is 70–99% complete and most answers are correct. This is the expected level of performance. ✔−: (15 points (50%) in gradebook) Problem set is less than 70% complete and/or most answers are incorrect. This indicates that you need to improve next time. I will hopefully not asisgn these often.  You may (and should!) work together on the problem sets, but you must turn in your own answers. You cannot work in groups of more than four people, and you must note who participated in the group in your assignment.\n Evaluation assignments For your final project, you will conduct a pre-registered evaluation of a social program using synthetic data. To (1) give you practice with the principles of program evaluation, research design, measurement, and causal diagrams, and (2) help you with the foundation of your final project, you will complete a set of four evaluation-related assignments.\nIdeally these will become major sections of your final project. However, there is no requirement that the programs you use in these assignments must be the same as the final project. If, through these assignments, you discover that your initially chosen program is too simple, too complex, too boring, etc., you can change at any time.\nThese assignments will be graded using the same check system from the problem sets.\n Code-through The objectives of this class include “Become curious and confident in consuming and producing evaluations,” “Run statistical models,” and “Share your analyses and data with the public.” To help you with this, you will write a code-through tutorial of some program evaluation principle or approach.\nOne of the reasons R is so popular is because the R community is exceptionally generous and open and sharing.4 The internet is full of tutorials and code-throughs where people explain how to do something interesting with R.\nYou will write one code-through or tutorial during the semester on a of your choice (related to program evaluation and causal inference, of course). You will complete this on your own, but you can get help from your team (but you can’t all write about the same topic). You can find the instructions for the assignment here.\nThis assignment will be graded using the same check system from the problem sets.\n Exams There will be two exams covering (1) program evaluation, design, and causation, and (2) the core statistical tools of program evaluation and causal inference.\nYou will take these exams online through iCollege. The exams will be timed, but you can use notes and readings and the Google. You must take the exams on your own though, and not talk to anyone about them.5\nI will post examples of exam questions prior to the actual exams.\n Final project At the end of the course, you will demonstrate your knowledge of program evaluation and causal inference by completing a final project.\nComplete details for the final project are here.\nThere is no final exam. This project is your final exam.\n  Take detailed notes, work through the example code and try to understand it, have vivid dreams about statistics, etc.↩︎\n Also (4) ask for help!↩︎\n But it would be amazing if you did!↩︎\n So are Python and other modern open source languages too.↩︎\n Again, be honest.↩︎\n   ","date":1588118400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"section","lang":"en","lastmod":1588118400,"objectID":"3aa23ffb1eb3dedbe4d8a9c2165e2c58","permalink":"/assignment/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/assignment/","section":"assignment","summary":"Preparation Problem sets Evaluation assignments Code-through Exams Final project   Preparation You will get the most out of this class if you (1) attend class, (2) complete all the readings, and (3) engage1 with the readings.2\nTo encourage attendance and preparation, I use an honor-system-based self-reporting system.

Some R developers have even started to adopt tutorial-focused approaches to development, where their code isn’t complete until they can easily teach it to others.\nThe code examples I include on each week’s class page and in the weekly RStudio.cloud projects are a good example of didactic tutorials. In addition, the R-Weekly e-mail newsletter includes dozens of these kinds of tutorials every week, and Mara Averick (chief tidyverse advocate at RStudio) regularly tweets out links to different posts as well. Here are some others examples to give you a jist of what you can do:2\n The Greatest Twitter Scheme of All Time?

Perhaps you want to show how DAGs are important and what you can do to control for back doors, or demonstrate how to run a regression discontinuity model, or how to make a plot that shows a program effect from a diff-in-diff model. This is entirely up to you!\n Write a tutorial that walks a reader through a demonstration of this concept. Your problem sets have been focused on a final product. In this assignment, here the focus is didactic. Show intermediate steps, explain why you do what you do, etc. The reader should learn something new from this tutorial.\nThere’s no word count here, but there should be several steps and examples of the concept you’re demonstrating.\nYou should write this in R Markdown, since that allows you to mix prose and code.\nYour demonstration must be reproducible. Use built-in datasets from the wooldridge package (like injury or jtrain2 or jtrain3 and so on), or use the wakefield package to simulate data, or point the reader to a CSV file from the internet and incorporate read_csv() into your code-through.\n Knit the final version of your tutorial as a PDF, Word file, or HTML file.\n Upload the knitted document to iCollege.\nIf you’re feeling especially brave, post the HTML version of your document to some public website (Medium, a personal blog, etc.), tell me, and I’ll promote it in the #rstats community on Twitter.

If you begin an intervention or launch a study prematurely, you can waste time and money—and potentially lives.\nEven if you have a well designed program with an impeccable logic model and a perfect DAG, you might discover (too late!) that you forgot to collect some critical variables or realize that your identification strategy will not work.\nFrom a more cynical perspective, you might (unethically) engage in the practice of p-hacking—running all sorts of different model specifications until you find the results you want, and then claim in your report that you had intended to run that model all along.\nOne increasingly popular method for (1) ensuring that your data and methods work before launching a study or intervention, and (2) declaring and committing to your hypotheses and methods and models before analyzing your data is to pre-register your research or evaluation. A pre-registered study contains all the background work—an introduction, literature review, theory, hypotheses, and proposed analysis—but without the actual data. Authors post their expectations and hypotheses publicly so they can be held publicly accountable for any deviations from their proposed design.1\nThe best preregistered studies use simulated data that has the same structure as the data that will be collected (i.e. same columns, sometimes the same correlations and relationships researchers expect to see in the collected data, etc.). Because there’s no data yet (or just fake data), you have more freedom when developing a preregistered study. You can experiment with different models, play with different approaches, manipulate data in different ways, and so on. If you realize that you need a new variable, or that you need to rearrange questions on a survey, or make any other kinds of changes, you can—you haven’t collected the data yet!\nOnce you finalize your plan and know all the data you need to collect, and once you’ve written out the different models you’ll run, all you have to do is collect the real data, plop it into your script (replacing the fake data you’d been using), and run the analysis script again to generate the actual, real results. In the results section, you get to either say “As predicted, we found…”, or “Contrary to expectations, we found that…”.\nFor your final project in this class, you will write a pre-registered analysis of a public or nonprofit social program that you’re interested in. You don’t need to worry about collecting data—you’ll create a synthetic dataset for your pre-analysis.\nYou will submit three things via iCollege:\nA PDF of your preregistered report (see the outline below for details of what this needs to contain). You should compile this with R Markdown. You might want to write the prose-heavy sections in a word processor like Word or Google Docs and copy/paste the text into your R Markdown document, since RStudio doesn’t have a nice spell checker or grammar checker. This should have no visible R code, warnings, or messages in it (set echo=FALSE at the beginning of your document before you knit). The same PDF as above, but with all the R code in it (set echo=TRUE at the beginning of your document and reknit the file). A CSV file of your fake data.  This project is due by 7:00 PM on Wednesday, April 29, 2020. No late work will be accepted.\nYou can either run the analysis in RStudio locally on your computer (highly recommended(!!), since you won’t have to worry about keeping all your work on RStudio’s servers), or use an RStudio.cloud project. You can make a copy of this RStudio.cloud project—it doesn’t have anything in it, but I have preinstalled all the packages we’ve used over the course of the semester, so you don’t have to.\n  Empty RStudio.cloud project  Empty RStudio project you can download and unzip on your computer (doesn’t include any packages, since you’re responsible for installing those)  Resources Most importantly, do not hesitate to work with classmates. You all must choose different programs, but you can work in groups of up to 4 people on your own projects. Also, absolutely do not hesitate to ask me questions! I’m here to help!\nYou might find this evaluation (and its proposal) of a truancy program in the Provo School District in Utah helpful as an example for the first half of this assignment (program overview, theory, implementation, threats to validity, and outcomes). The PSD evaluation doesn’t have DAGs or fancy econometrics models like RCTs, diff-in-diff, RDD, IVs, or anything like that, so you can’t use it as an example of that part, but these should provide a good template for the program-specific sections. This is longer than expected for this class. I provide suggested word counts in the outline below.\n  psd-proposal-2011  psd-final-report-2012   Suggested outline Here’s an outline of what you’ll need to do.2 You can download this as an RMarkdown file and change the text if you want. I’ve also included this as an RMarkdown file in the empty RStudio.cloud project.\n  final-project-template.Rmd  Introduction Describe the motivation for this evaluation, briefly describe the program to be evaluated, and explain why it matters for society. (≈150 words)\n Program overview Provide in-depth background about the program. Include details about (1) when it was started, (2) why it was started, (3) what it was designed to address in society. If the program hasn’t started yet, explain why it’s under consideration. (≈300 words)\n Program theory and implementation Program theory and impact theory graph Explain and explore the program’s underlying theory. Sometimes programs will explain why they exist in a mission statement, but often they don’t and you have to infer the theory from what the program looks like when implemented. What did the program designers plan on occurring? Was this theory based on existing research? If so, cite it. (≈300 words)\nInclude a simple impact theory graph showing the program’s basic activities and outcomes. Recall from class and your reading that this is focused primarily on the theory and mechanisms, not on the implementation of the program.\n Logic model Describe the program’s inputs, activities, outputs, and outcomes. Pay careful attention to how they are linked—remember that every input needs to flow into an activity and every output must flow out of an activity. (≈150 words)\nUse flowchart software to connect the inputs, activities, outputs, and outcomes and create a complete logic model. Include this as a figure.\n  Outcome and causation Main outcome Select one of the program’s outcomes to evaluate. Explain why you’ve chosen this (is it the most important? easiest to measure? has the greatest impact on society?) (≈50 words)\n Measurement Using the concept of the “ladder of abstraction” that we discussed in class (e.g. identifying a witch, measuring poverty, etc.), make a list of all the possible attributes of the outcome. Narrow this list down to 3-4 key attributes. Discuss how you decided to narrow the concepts and justify why you think these attributes capture the outcome. Then, for each of these attributes, answer these questions:\n Measurable definition: How would you specifically define this attribute? (i.e. if the attribute is “reduced crime”, define it as “The percent change in crime in a specific neighborhood during a certain time frame” or something similar) Ideal measurement: How would you measure this attribute in an ideal world? Feasible measurement: How would you measure this given reality and given limitations in budget, time, etc.? Measurement of program effect: How would to connect this measure to people in the program? How would you check to see if the program itself had an effect?  (≈150 words in this section)\n Causal theory Given your measurement approach, describe and draw a causal diagram (DAG) that shows how your program causes the outcome. Note that this is not the same thing as the logic model—you’ll likely have nodes in the DAG that aren’t related to the program at all (like socioeconomic status, gender, experience, or other factors). The logic model provides the framework for the actual implementation of your program and connects all the moving parts to the outcomes. The DAG is how you can prove causation with statistical approaches. (≈150 words)\n Hypotheses Make predictions of your program’s effect. Declare what you think will happen. (≈50 words)\n  Data and methods Identification strategy How will you measure the actual program effect? Will you rely on an RCT? Differences-in-differences? Regression discontinuity? Instrumental variables? How does your approach account for selection bias and endogeneity? How does your approach isolate the causal effect of the program on the outcome?\nAlso briefly describe what kinds of threats to internal and external validity you face in your study.\n(≈300 words)\n Data Given your measurement approach, limits on feasibility, and identification strategy, describe the data you will use. Will you rely on administrative data collected by a government agency or nonprofit? Will you collect your own data? If so, what variables will you measure, and how? Will you conduct a survey or rely on outside observers or do something else? What does this data look like? What variables does it (or should it) include?\n(≈100 words)\n  Synthetic analysis Generate a synthetic (fake) dataset in R with all the variables you’ll need for the real life analysis. Analyze the data using your identification strategy. For instance:\n If you’re relying on observational data, close all the backdoors, don’t adjust for colliders, and make a strong argument for isolation of the causal effect in the absence of treatment/control groups If you’re doing an RCT, test the differences in means in the treatment and control groups (and follow all other best practices listed in the World Bank book, checking for balance across groups, etc.) If you’re doing diff-in-diff, run a regression model with an interaction term to show the diff-in-diff If you’re doing regression discontinuity, check for a jump in the outcome variable at the cutoff in the running variable If you’re using instrumental variables, check the validity of your instrument and run a 2SLS model  Include robustness checks to ensure the validity of your effect (i.e. if you’re doing regression discontinuity, test different bandwidths and kernel types; etc.)\n(As many words as you need to fully describe your analysis and results)\n Conclusion What would the findings from this analysis mean for your selected program? What would it mean if you found an effect? What would it mean if you didn’t find an effect? Why does any of this matter? (≈75 words)\n   See the Center for Open Science’s directory of preregistrations, or AsPredicted list for examples of this in real life.

You will use RStudio as the main program to access R. Think of R as an engine and RStudio as a car dashboard—R handles all the calculations and the actual statistics, while RStudio provides a nice interface for running R code.\nRStudio.cloud R is free, but it can sometimes be a pain to install and configure. To make life easier, you can (and should!) use the free RStudio.cloud service initially, which lets you run a full instance of RStudio in your web browser. This means you won’t have to install anything on your computer to get started with R! We will have a shared class workspace in RStudio.cloud that will let you quickly copy templates for labs and problem sets.\nGo to https://rstudio.cloud/ and create an account. You’ll receive a link to join the shared class workspace separately. If you don’t get this link, let me know and I will invite you.\n RStudio on your computer RStudio.cloud is convenient, but it can be slow and it is not designed to be able to handle larger datasets, more complicated analysis, or fancier graphics. Over the course of the semester, you should wean yourself off of RStudio.cloud and install all these things locally. This is also important if you want to customize fonts, since RStudio.cloud has extremely limited support for fonts other than Helvetica.\nHere’s how you install all these things\nInstall R First you need to install R itself (the engine).\nGo to the CRAN (Collective R Archive Network)1 website: https://cran.r-project.org/\n Click on “Download R for XXX”, where XXX is either Mac or Windows:\n If you use macOS, scroll down to the first .pkg file in the list of files (in this picture, it’s R-3.5.1.pkg; as of right now, the current version is 3.6.1) and download it.\n If you use Windows, click “base” (or click on the bolded “install R for the first time” link) and download it.\n  Double click on the downloaded file (check your Downloads folder). Click yes through all the prompts to install like any other program.\n   Install RStudio Next, you need to install RStudio, the nicer graphical user interface (GUI) for R (the dashboard). Once R and RStudio are both installed, you can ignore R and only use RStudio. RStudio will use R automatically and you won’t ever have to interact with it directly.\nGo to the free download location on RStudio’s website: https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/#download\n Select the installer that corresponds with your computer’s operating system (Windows or macOS):\n Double click on the downloaded file (again, check your Downloads folder). Click yes through all the prompts to install like any other program.\n  Double click on RStudio to run it (check your applications folder or start menu).\n Install tidyverse R packages are easy to install with RStudio. Select the packages panel, click on “Install,” type the name of the package you want to install, and press enter.\nThis can sometimes be tedious when you’re installing lots of packages, though. The tidyverse2 for instance, consists of dozens of packages that all work together. Rather than install each individually, you can install a single magical package and get them all at the same time.\nGo to the packages panel in RStudio, click on “Install,” type “tidyverse”, and press enter. You’ll see a bunch of output in the RStudio console as all the tidyverse packages are installed.\nNotice also that RStudio will generate a line of code for you and run it: install.packages(\"tidyverse\"). You can also just paste and run this instead of using the packages panel.\n   It’s a goofy name, but CRAN is where most R packages—and R itself—lives.↩︎\n A universe of packages centered around tidy data, including ggplot2↩︎\n   ","date":1576540800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1576540800,"objectID":"32d2aa5db9c906dd4dae32456ff00876","permalink":"/reference/install/","publishdate":"2019-12-17T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/reference/install/","section":"reference","summary":"RStudio.cloud RStudio on your computer  Install R Install RStudio Install tidyverse    You will do all of your work in this class with the open source (and free!) programming language R.

Goodman  212 IASBO  cgoodman@niu.edu  @cbgoodman  Schedule an appointment   Course details  Wednesdays  August 19–October 7, 2020  5:00–10:00 PM  NIU-Naperville   Contacting me E-mail is the best way to get in contact with me. I will try to respond to all course-related e-mails within 24 hours (really), but also remember that life can be busy and chaotic for everyone (including me!), so if I don't respond to your e-mail right away, don't worry!\n  Course objectives By the end of this course, you (1) will be literate in the language of causal inference, (2) will communicate evaluation outcomes clearly, and (3) will understand the ethics and limits of data analysis by designing, critiquing, coding, and running rigorous, valid, and feasible evaluations of public sector programs focused on society’s most pressing problems.\nSpecifically, you’ll be able to:\n Explain the philosophy of causation Identify and diagram program logic models Outline theories of change with directed acyclic graphs (DAGs) Summarize key threats to causal inference, identify these threats in evaluations, and mitigate these threats with research design Develop rigorous and valid statistical measures Run statistical models Explain the theory, research design, methods, and results of evaluations to all types of stakeholders, from highly trained econometricians to the general public Share your analyses and data with the public Identify ethical issues and limits in data science and program evaluation Become curious and confident in consuming and producing evaluations   Course philosophy Classical statistics classes spend substantial time covering probability theory, null hypothesis testing, and other statistical tests first developed hundreds of years ago. Some classes don’t use software or actual real data and instead live in the world of mathematical proofs. They can be math-heavy and full of often unintuitive concepts and equations.\nIn this class, we will take the opposite approach. We begin with data and learn how to tidy, wrangle, manipulate, and visualize it with code. Later in the semester we’ll turn to the powerful toolbox of causal inference approaches, but continue to keep the focus on data as we do so.\nIn other words, there’s way less of this:\n\\[ f(x) = \\dfrac{1}{\\sqrt{2\\pi}} e^{-\\frac12 x^2} \\]\nAnd way more of this:\nsummary_monthly_temp \u0026lt;- weather %\u0026gt;% group_by(month) %\u0026gt;% summarize(mean = mean(temp), std_dev = sd(temp)) Over the last decade there has been a revolution in statistical and scientific computing. Open source languages like R and Python have overtaken older (and expensive!) corporate software packages like SAS and SPSS, and there are now thousands of books and blog posts and other online resources with excellent tutorials about how to analyze pretty much any kind of data.\nThis class will expose you to R—one of the most popular, sought-after, and in-demand statistical programming languages. Armed with the foundation of R skills you’ll learn in this class, you’ll know enough to be able to find how to analyze any sort of data-based question in the future.\n Important pep talk! I promise you can succeed in this class.\nLearning R can be difficult at first—it’s like learning a new language, just like Spanish, French, or Chinese. Hadley Wickham—the chief data scientist at RStudio and the author of some amazing R packages you’ll be using like ggplot2—made this wise observation:\n It’s easy when you start out programming to get really frustrated and think, “Oh it’s me, I’m really stupid,” or, “I’m not made out to program.” But, that is absolutely not the case. Everyone gets frustrated. I still get frustrated occasionally when writing R code. It’s just a natural part of programming. So, it happens to everyone and gets less and less over time. Don’t blame yourself. Just take a break, do something fun, and then come back and try again later.\n Even experienced programmers and evaluators find themselves bashing their heads against seemingly intractable errors. If you’re finding yourself taking way too long hitting your head against a wall and not understanding, take a break, talk to classmates, e-mail me, etc.\n\n Course materials Most of the readings in this class are free.\nBooks We will only use one physical textbook. There are three official textbooks for the class:\n Paul J. Gertler et al., Impact Evaluation in Practice, 2nd ed. (Inter-American Development Bank; World Bank, 2016), https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/handle/10986/25030. (Free!) Scott Cunningham, Causal Inference: The Mixtape, 2018, https://www.scunning.com/mixtape.html. (Also free!) Joshua D. Angrist and Jörn-Steffen Pischke, Mastering ’Metrics: The Path from Cause to Effect (Princeton, NJ: Princeton University Press, 2015). ($25 used or $30 new at Amazon)  The World Bank’s Impact Evaluation in Practice will be our main textbook. It’s written at a general, easy-to-understand level with relatively minimal math. Mastering ’Metrics goes into more depth about the mechanics of different causal inference approaches and has a bit more math, but it’s still fairly accessible. Causal Inference: The Mixtape has even more math, but hopefully not an excessively terrifying amount.\nYou do not need to understand all the equations and notation. If your eyes start to gloss over the Greek letters and subscripts, it’s okay. Try to learn them, but don’t stress out about it too much.\n Articles, book chapters, and other materials There will also occasionally be additional articles and videos to read and watch. When this happens, links to these other resources will be included on the reading page for that week.\n R and RStudio You will do all of your analysis with the open source (and free!) programming language R. You will use RStudio as the main program to access R. Think of R as an engine and RStudio as a car dashboard—R handles all the calculations and the actual statistics, while RStudio provides a nice interface for running R code.\nR is free, but it can sometimes be a pain to install and configure. To make life easier, you can (and should!) use the free RStudio.cloud service, which lets you run a full instance of RStudio in your web browser. This means you won’t have to install anything on your computer to get started with R! We will have a shared class workspace in RStudio.cloud that will let you quickly copy templates for labs and problem sets.\nRStudio.cloud is convenient, but it can be slow and it is not designed to be able to handle larger datasets or more complicated analysis. Over the course of the semester, you’ll probably want to get around to installing R, RStudio, and other R packages on your computer and wean yourself off of RStudio.cloud. This isn’t necessary, but it’s helpful.\nYou can find instructions for installing R, RStudio, and all the tidyverse packages here.\n Online help Data science and statistical programming can be difficult. Computers are stupid and little errors in your code can cause hours of headache (even if you’ve been doing this stuff for years!).\nFortunately there are tons of online resources to help you with this. Two of the most important are StackOverflow (a Q\u0026amp;A site with hundreds of thousands of answers to all sorts of programming questions) and RStudio Community (a forum specifically designed for people using RStudio and the tidyverse (i.e. you)).\n  Course policies Be nice. Be honest. Don’t cheat.\nWe will also follow Georgia State’s Code of Conduct.\nCourse evaluation and evolution This syllabus reflects a plan for the semester. Deviations may become necessary as the semester progresses.\nBecause this is a new class (and because this is the first time this course has been taught with R at the Andrew Young School), there will be inevitable bumps along the way. Please be patient as we get everything ironed out!\nI’d love your help to help improve the class as we go. To facilitate this, I have a couple requests:\nAt the end of every class, there will be a link to an anonymous Google Form with a few quick questions asking about the clearest and muddiest things from that day. Please fill this out regularly. It will be hard to remember, since we get out so late, but it’s extraordinarily helpful for me.\n At some point in the middle of the semester, someone from GSU’s Center for Excellence in Teaching and Learning (CETL) will come and run a 25 minute Group Instructional Feedback Technique (GIFT) session, where I’ll step out and you’ll all talk to them about the class. Don’t worry—the people from CETL are super nice :)\n  Also, please take the time to fill out the official GSU course evaluation at the end of the semester!\n Student hours Please watch this video:\n Student hours are set times dedicated to all of you (most professors call these “office hours”; I don’t1). This means that I will be in my office (wistfully) waiting for you to come by with whatever questions you have. This is the best and easiest way to find me outside of class and the best chance for discussing class material and concerns. Please come by!\nOutside of regularly scheduled student hours, you can easily make an appointment with me online.\nThis can be a difficult class. Do not suffer in silence! Come talk to me!\n Class conduct and expectations On the first day of class, will come up with rules, expectations, and policies regarding laptop use and other issues. Those will be listed here.\n Laptops This is a computer-heavy course and each class session will require extensive laptop use. Occasionally I may ask that laptops be closed for some in-class activities, but in general you will be expected to use your computer. Use your computer responsibly in class.\n Counseling and Psychological Services (CPS) Life at GSU can be complicated and challenging. You might feel overwhelmed, experience anxiety or depression, or struggle with relationships or family responsibilities. Counseling and Psychological Services (CPS) provides free, confidential support for students who are struggling with mental health and emotional challenges. The CPS office is staffed by professional psychologists who are attuned to the needs of all types of college and professional students. Please do not hesitate to contact CPS for assistance—getting help is a smart and courageous thing to do.\n Basic needs security If you have difficulty affording groceries or accessing sufficient food to eat every day, or if you lack a safe and stable place to live, and you believe this may affect your performance in this course, please contact the Dean of Students for support. They can provide a host of services including free groceries from the Panther Pantry and assisting with homelessness with the Embark Network. Additionally, please talk to me if you are comfortable in doing so. This will enable me to provide any resources that I might possess.\n Children in class I applaud all of you who go to graduate school with children! It is difficult to balance academic, work, and family commitments, and I want you to succeed. Here are my policies regarding children in class:\nAll breastfeeding babies are welcome in class as often as necessary. Non-nursing babies and older children are welcome whenever alternate arrangements cannot be made. As a parent of five young children, I understand that babysitters fall through, partners have conflicting schedules, children get sick, and other issues arise that leave parents with few other options. In cases where children come to class, I invite parents/caregivers to sit close to the door so as to more easily excuse yourself to attend to your child’s needs. Non-parents in the class: please reserve seats near the door for your parenting classmates. All students are expected to join with me in creating a welcoming environment that is respectful of your classmates who bring children to class.  I understand that sleep deprivation and exhaustion are among the most difficult aspects of parenting young children. The struggle of balancing school, work, childcare, and graduate school is tiring, and I will do my best to accommodate any such issues while maintaining the same high expectations for all students enrolled in the class. Please do not hesitate to contact me with any questions or concerns.\n Lauren’s Promise I will listen and believe you if someone is threatening you.\nLauren McCluskey, a 21-year-old honors student athlete, was murdered on October 22, 2018 by a man she briefly dated on the University of Utah campus. We must all take action to ensure that this never happens again.\nIf you are in immediate danger, call 911 or GSU police (404-413-3333).\nIf you are experiencing sexual assault, domestic violence, or stalking, please report it to me and I will connect you to resources or call GSU’s Counseling and Psychological Services (404-413-1640).\nAny form of sexual harassment or violence will not be excused or tolerated at Georgia State. GSU has instituted procedures to respond to violations of these laws and standards, programs aimed at the prevention of such conduct, and intervention on behalf of the victims. Georgia State University Police officers will treat victims of sexual assault, domestic violence, and stalking with respect and dignity. Advocates on campus and in the community can help with victims’ physical and emotional health, reporting options, and academic concerns.\n Academic honesty Violation of GSU’s Policy on Academic Honesty will result in an F in the course and possible disciplinary action.2 All violations will be formally reported to the Dean of Students.\n Special needs Students who wish to request accommodation for a disability may do so by registering with the Office of Disability Services. Students may only be accommodated upon issuance by the Office of Disability Services of a signed Accommodation Plan and are responsible for providing a copy of that plan to instructors of all classes in which accommodations are sought.\nStudents with special needs should then make an appointment with me during the first week of class to discuss any accommodations that need to be made.\n  Assignments and grades You can find descriptions for all the assignments on the assignments page.\n   Assignment Points Percent    Preparation (≈ 15.5 × 14) 210 22.3%  Problem sets (6 × 30) 180 19.1%  Evaluation assignments (4 × 30) 120 12.8%  Code-through 30 3.2%  Exam 1 100 10.6%  Exam 2 100 10.6%  Final project 200 21.3%  Total 940 —        Grade Range Grade Range    A 93–100% C 73–76%  A− 90–92% C− 70–72%  B+ 87–89% D+ 67–69%  B 83–86% D 63–66%  B− 80–82% D− 60–62%  C+ 77–79% F \u0026lt; 60%      Star Wars Once you have read this entire syllabus and the assignments page, please click here and e-mail me a picture of a cute Star Wars character.3 Brownie points if it’s animated.\n    There’s fairly widespread misunderstanding about what office hours actually are! Many students often think that they are the times I shouldn’t be disturbed, which is the exact opposite of what they’re for.↩︎\n So seriously, just don’t cheat or plagiarize!↩︎\n Baby Yoda, Babu Frik, porgs, etc. are all super fair game.↩︎\n   ","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":-62135596800,"objectID":"e4d5a4a79239f08c6ad0d7cbf1be756c","permalink":"/syllabus/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/syllabus/","section":"","summary":"Course objectives Course philosophy Important pep talk!
